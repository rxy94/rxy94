### Hi there 👋

- 💻 I’m currently learning Web Application Development in CPIFP Alan Turing, Campanillas, Malaga.
- 🔮 I am hoping to learn a lot of web development skills in this course and be able to meet and work alongside great people in this field.
- 🏥 I graduated as a nurse at the University of Malaga on 2016 and worked in Ireland for 5 years.
- 🏞️ I like nature and going for light hiking.
- 👻 And also like watching movies, especially horror movies!
