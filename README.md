# 💫 About Me:

Hi! I'm Ruyi, a web application developer with recent training in programming and a previous career as a registered general nurse. After several years in the healthcare field, I decided to make a professional shift towards software development, an area that has always fascinated me for its blend of logic, creativity, and problem-solving.

I specialize in backend development, with a strong interest in architectures such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and hexagonal architecture, as well as in database design and optimization. I'm currently pursuing a specialization course in AI and Big Data, expanding my knowledge in these transformative technologies and how they can be applied to create innovative solutions.

During my internship at a technology company, I worked in a demanding professional environment as part of a multidisciplinary team. I contributed to the development and deployment of an API using technologies like PHP, Laravel, Docker, and AWS, following best practices in clean code and automated testing.

I'm a consistent and growth-oriented person who enjoys learning, collaborating, and sharing knowledge. I always look for ways to improve my work, combining logic, empathy, and critical thinking.
